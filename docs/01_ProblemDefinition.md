An aspect of the french language that I have struggled with is noun genders.
In my personal experience reason for for this are twofold:

Firstly, unlike other aspects of the french language, noun genders in french have not greatly
improved my ability to express myself, or understand others. Correct understanding of
conjugations, gramatical structures, and a larger vocabularies quickly improves the
amount of things you can express or understand, and pronunciation ensures that what you
say or hear is understood. Genders do not really confur much information in themselves
though you do provide some structural clarity, and certainly they must play a role in
the recognition of vocabulary.

Because of this, a language learner not already accustomed to noun genders has little
reason to learn them other than that speak more authentically and certainly to annoy
french speakers less.

Secondly, the speaking of french genders is not approached very well in my experience.
The normal approach for learning french nouns is to introduce them by rote starting with
common nouns and trying to associate them strongly with the concept they represent. I think
this does a reasonable job at learning to say/write/recognise the words I think it does very
little to associate the genders to these words, and even less to teach intuitive rules for 
noun genders. Further more I feel like a superier method of teaching would be to focus on
spoken language rather than written language, which I feel is greatly underemphisised.
